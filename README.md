# Viego
Assignment 1 of ID. A website where one can purchase gaming peripherals and PC parts.

VIEGO
Viego is a designed to aid gamers in choosing the right equipment for them regardless of their budget. In Viego you can buy the highest quality pc parts, gears and builds- ranging from Budget all the way up to, simply, Ludicrous. Anyone can be a gamer, no limits. 

Design Process
I went for a minimalistic design as where the focus is on what matters. And also most website these days go for a minimalistic design. This design highlights what matters to the user, hence making it visual pleasing and easy to navigate through. This website is made for everyone who wants a good computer or good gears for their computers. So, the design need not have to be over the top. It is very user-friendly, fro example a drag down menu will appear, for quick and easy navigation, if they scroll further down a page that is really long. I prioritized user-friendliness and simple design because it targets at a wide range of people.

Technologies Used
In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

JQuery
The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.
Testing
For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
