# Viego
Assignment 1 of ID. A website where one can purchase gaming peripherals and PC parts.

VIEGO
Viego is a designed to aid gamers in choosing the right equipment for them regardless of their budget. In Viego you can buy the highest quality pc parts, gears and builds- ranging from Budget all the way up to, simply, Ludicrous. Anyone can be a gamer, no limits. 

Design Process
I went for a minimalistic design as where the focus is on what matters. And also most website these days go for a minimalistic design. This design highlights what matters to the user, hence making it visual pleasing and easy to navigate through. This website is made for everyone who wants a good computer or good gears for their computers. So, the design need not have to be over the top. It is very user-friendly, fro example a drag down menu will appear, for quick and easy navigation, if they scroll further down a page that is really long. I prioritized user-friendliness and simple design because it targets at a wide range of people. 

Features
Feature 1- Allows users to go to specific parts of the page when they have scrolled too far. This is achieved by a drop down menu showing up after scrolling down. This is for easy accessability. 

Feature 2- All pages lead back to the homepage and from each you can easily go to the other page without having to leave the particular page. This achieved through the extensive linking that I did. This way, navigations are way more easier. 

Feature 3- Pages involving products are automatically sorted according to price and performance. So from the cheapest to the most expensive. I wanted to implemented such that it could sort by how the user wanted it to be sorted but there wasn't much time to implement it.
